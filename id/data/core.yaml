      # Help

      This is an editor for [OpenHistoricalMap](http://www.openhistoricalmap.org/),
      a collaborative project for those who wants to map the past. You can use it to
      add and update data in your area, or somewhere else in the world.

      Edits that you make on this map will be visible to everyone who uses
      OpenHistoricalMap. In order to make an edit, you'll need to [log in](http://www.openhistoricalmap.org/login).

      The [iD editor](http://ideditor.com/) is a collaborative project with
      [source code available on GitHub](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD).
      This particular instance of the iD editor is specifically developed for
      the OpenHistoricalMap project.

      # Editing & Saving

      This editor is designed to work primarily online, and you're accessing
      it through a website right now.

      ### Selecting Features

      To select a map feature, like a road or point of interest, click
      on it on the map. This will highlight the selected feature, open a panel with
      details about it, and show a menu of things you can do with the feature.

      To select multiple features, hold down the 'Shift' key. Then either click
      on the features you want to select, or drag on the map to draw a rectangle.
      This will draw a box and select all the points within it.

      ### Saving Edits

      When you make changes like editing roads, buildings, and places, these are
      stored locally until you save them to the server. Don't worry if you make
      a mistake - you can undo changes by clicking the undo button, and redo
      changes by clicking the redo button.

      Click 'Save' to finish a group of edits - for instance, if you've completed
      an area of town and would like to start on a new area. You'll have a chance
      to review what you've done, and the editor supplies helpful suggestions
      and warnings if something doesn't seem right about the changes.

      If everything looks good, you can enter a short comment explaining the change
      you made, and click 'Save' again to post the changes
      to [OpenHistoricalMap.org](http://www.openhistoricalmap.org/), where they are visible
      to all other users and available for others to build and improve upon.

      If you can't finish your edits in one sitting, you can leave the editor
      window and come back (on the same browser and computer), and the
      editor application will offer to restore your work.
    imagery: |
      # Imagery

      Imagery is an important resource for mapping. A combination of
      historical maps, and statellite imagery are available in the editor
      under the 'Background Settings' menu on the right. The options in under
      backgrounds settings might differ from location to loaction.

      Imagery is sometimes offset from the map data because of a mistake on the
      imagery provider's side. If you see a lot of roads shifted from the background,
      don't immediately move them all to match the background. Instead you can adjust
      the imagery so that it matches the existing data by clicking 'Fix alignment' at
      the bottom of the Background Settings UI.

      ###Using Custom Imagery

      You can use your own maps or out-of-copyrigth maps as backgrounds by choosing
      'custom' under 'Background Settings'. This requries that you have a tile URL(web address)
      to your map. [Map Wraper](http://mapwarper.net/) is a tool that allows you to get such a URL.
      Note that other existing maps at Map Warper migth not be aviable under the public domain or
      a public domain like license. For more information on copyright see 'Copyright/Sources'.
    inspector: |
      # Using the Inspector

      The inspector is the section on the left side of the page that allows you to
      edit the details of the selected feature.

      ### Selecting a Feature Type

      After you add a point, line, or area, you can choose what type of feature it
      is, like whether it's a highway or residential road, ruin or town.
      The inspector will display buttons for common feature types, and you can
      find others by typing what you're looking for in the search box.

      Click the 'i' in the bottom-right-hand corner of a feature type button to
      learn more about it. Click a button to choose that type.

      ### Using Forms and Editing Tags

      After you choose a feature type, or when you select a feature that already
      has a type assigned, the inspector will display fields with details about
      the feature like its name and address.

      Below the fields you see, you can click icons to add other details,
      like [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) information, notes, and more.

      At the bottom of the inspector, click 'Additional tags' to add arbitrary
      other tags to the element. [Taginfo](http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/) is a
      great resource for learn more about popular tag combinations.

      Changes you make in the inspector are automatically applied to the map.
      You can undo them at any time by clicking the 'Undo' button.

    copyrigth_sources: |
      # Copyright/Sources

      When adding data to OpenHistoricalMap make sure that you are allowed
      to use your source. Your source can't require attribution and should be
      in the public domain or using a public domain like license, such as
      [Creative Commons: CC0 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

      ###Out of Copyright

      The copyright expiry date varies for different countries and map producers.
      The OpenStreetMap Wiki provides a great summary with more information on
      the subject: [Out of Copyright Maps](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Out-of-copyright_maps)

      ###Free and Open Sources

      [The New York Public](http://maps.nypl.org/warper/) Library has a great collection of maps licensed under a
      public domain like license. You can add one of these maps as a background directly
      in this editor, using the tiles link available under each maps export tab.
      For more about custom backgrounds see 'Imagery'.

      Another great resource for old public domain maps is Europeana, Europeana allows you
      to search for maps and filter away results that is not licensed under the public domain.
      [Example search: Public domain maps London](http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=what%3Amaps+london&rows=24&qf=RIGHTS%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Fpublicdomain%2Fmark%2F1.0%2F*&qt=false)
